Magnetic dynamics of magnetic material has drawn a lot of attention due to their potential application in next generation high speed, low cost device as building block of 'beyond Moore'. It's crutial to make sense of the dynamics of such magnetic material. Conventional MOKE and MOKE imaging technique enable us to explore DC "
